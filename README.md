## * Summarization of the total sales per region
This was done with the use of Microsoft EXCEL and the result is displayed below.


The highest total sales (24,298) was recorded at South Region while the lowest total sales was recorded at West Region. West Region had the lowest sales (11,400) with reasons probably low advertisement, staff attitude etc.
We recommend that the company look keenly into the West region and make some adjustments so as to boost sales in that region.

## * Summarization of the total sales per product
This was done with the use of Microsoft EXCEL and the result is displayed below.



The product with the highest total sales is hat while the product with the lowest total sales is jacket. 23% of the total sales came from hat.

The management of the company might take a survey to get interested jackets brand from society and introduce such jackets to the company.
